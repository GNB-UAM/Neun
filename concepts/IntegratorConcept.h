/* * \class IntegratorConcept
  * * A model of this concept must meet the requirements for SystemArchetype plus:
  * * The following static methods
  * * \li void step(System &s, precission_t h, precission_t * const variables, precission_t * const parameters)
  * * This method must calculate the next state of the system given the current values of the variables and parameters.
  * * The method must be static, so it can be called without an instance of the Integrator.
  * * The method must take a reference to the system, the time step, and pointers to the variables and parameters.
  * * The method must not return anything, as it modifies the system's state directly.
