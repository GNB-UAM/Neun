# Neun

![CMake v2.8 dependency](https://img.shields.io/badge/cmake-v2.8-blue?style=flat-square)

A library for the simulation of dynamical systems, aimed to model neural
networks with high performance. It is written in an object oriented fashion
with heavily templated C++.

Forked from: https://code.launchpad.net/~elferdo/neun/trunk

## Build

To build it, just type:
```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
```

Install it using:
```
make install
```

The library will install a pkg-config file called "neun.pc" under
${prefix}/${project_name}/${project_version}/pkgconfig. If you want
other applications to be able to find it, you must add this directory
to your PKG_CONFIG_PATH

<!--  
USING ECLIPSE

cmake -G"Eclipse CDT4 - Unix Makefiles" -D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. 
-->


Note that Makefile has been generated in build directory and after running:
```
make 
```

two executable files will be generated in build/examples, corresponding to basic.cpp and synapse.cpp

## Usage

In order to perform any simulation first you need to define the numerical integrator you are going to use, e.g.:
```
typedef RungeKutta4 Integrator;
```

Then, you define the neuron model and the precision of the simulation, e.g.:
```
typedef HodgkinHuxleyModel<double> HHModel;
```

Finally, you wrapp the model and the numerical integrator to build an integrable dynamical system, e.g.:
```
typedef DifferentialNeuronWrapper<HHModel, Integrator> Neuron;
```

You can manually compile your code from your project dir by running:
```
g++ -o mysimulation mysimulation.cpp -I/usr/local/Neun/0.3.2/
